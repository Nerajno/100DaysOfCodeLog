## 1. Sample Entry
### Day 1: February 26, 2019 - Tuesday
=======
## 31. Checkout Page
### Day 31: August 30, 2019 - Friday

**Project:** [Complete React Developer in 2019 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) - Neagoie & Zhang

[![App](assets/images/r6d31-small.jpg)](assets/images/r6d31.jpg)<br>
<span class="center bold">Checkout Page</span>

**Progress:**

In this lesson I built the cart page which allows the quantity to be updated and also allows removing of items from the cart.

This was done with

- Redux Actions
- Redux Reducers
- Utility functions

The cartItem component looks like this.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';

import {
  addItem,
  removeItem,
  clearItemFromCart
} from '../../redux/cart/cart.actions';

import './checkout-item.styles.scss';

const CheckoutItem = ({ cartItem, clearItem, addItem, removeItem }) => {
  const { name, imageUrl, price, quantity } = cartItem;
  return (
    <div className="checkout-item">
      <div className="image-container">
        <img src={imageUrl} alt="item" />
      </div>
      <span className="name">{name}</span>
      <span className="quantity">
        <div className="arrow" onClick={() => removeItem(cartItem)}>
          &#10094;
        </div>
        <span className="value">{quantity}</span>
        <div className="arrow" onClick={() => addItem(cartItem)}>
          &#10095;
        </div>
      </span>
      <span className="price">{price}</span>
      <span className="remove-button" onClick={() => clearItem(cartItem)}>
        &#10005;
      </span>
    </div>
  );
};

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  clearItem: item => dispatch(clearItemFromCart(item)),
  addItem: item => dispatch(addItem(item)),
  removeItem: item => dispatch(removeItem(item))
});

export default connect(
  null,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(CheckoutItem);
```

## 30. Cart Display
### Day 30: August 28, 2019 - Wednesday

**Project:** [Complete React Developer in 2019 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) - Neagoie & Zhang

<span class="center bold">Cart Display</span>

**Progress:**

This lesson dealt with creating the CartItem component to display products added to the cart.

It uses the connect() method of 'react-redux' to access the store.

This is displayed in our Redux logger.

Multiple items are handled with a cart utility function.

**Project:** Code Log Template

[![new code log](assets/images/day1-small.jpg)](assets/images/day1.jpg)

**Progress:** Created a new GitHub repo for my code log.

This repo is redesigned so that it can be forked and cloned for others to use. I'm still in the process of writing out the README to cover the following areas

- installation
- usage
- customization
- image optimization
- set-up & testing
